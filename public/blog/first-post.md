# My First Blog Post

Welcome to my blog! This is an example of how you can write blog posts in markdown format.

## Features

- **Markdown support**: Write your posts in markdown
- **Metadata**: Use frontmatter for post metadata
- **Syntax highlighting**: Code blocks are highlighted
- **Responsive design**: Works on all devices

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function BlogPost({ title, content }) {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      <div>{content}</div>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

This blog system makes it easy to write and publish posts. Just create a new markdown file in the `public/blog` directory and it will automatically appear on your blog page!
