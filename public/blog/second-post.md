# Building a Portfolio with React

Creating a personal portfolio is essential for showcasing your skills and projects to potential employers or clients.

## Tech Stack

For this portfolio, I chose:

- **React 19**: For the UI framework
- **TypeScript**: For type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Vite**: For fast development and building

## Key Features

### Responsive Design
The portfolio is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.

### Performance Optimized
Using Vite ensures fast build times and optimal bundle sizes.

### Modern UI
Clean, modern design following current web design trends.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-portfolio --template react-ts
cd my-portfolio
npm install
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
npm run dev
```

This gives you a solid foundation to build upon!
